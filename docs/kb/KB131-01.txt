The information in this article applies to:
	Delta Forth .NET 1.31
----

SYMPTOMS:
DO-LOOP structure behaves incorrectly.
The following Forth code:

:MAIN 5 0 DO I . SPACE LOOP;

should print 0 1 2 3 4 but instead it prints 0 1 2 3 4 5.

The same applies for the step loop version (+LOOP).

CAUSE:
DO-LOOP index was not decremented by 1.

STATUS:
Fixed in version 1.4
