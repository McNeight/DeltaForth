The information in this article applies to:
	Delta Forth .NET 1.0 Beta 2a
----

SYMPTOMS:
Delta Forth programs cannot call methods in libraries written with other .NET
tools if the classes are nested within namespaces.

CAUSE:
Separating the class name from the method name is done by looking for the first
dot sign from the left. Instead, the parsing should be done from the right.

STATUS:
Fixed in version 1.0
