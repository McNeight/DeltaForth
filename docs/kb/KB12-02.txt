The information in this article applies to:
	Delta Forth .NET 1.2
----

SYMPTOMS:
Constructors are not called in the C# Library1 sample file.

CAUSE:
The C# constructors are not declared static so they are only called when
the class is instantiated, which never actually happens. Since only static
methods can be called from the Delta Forth .NET system, constructors must be
declared static in order them to be called.

STATUS:
Fixed in version 1.3
