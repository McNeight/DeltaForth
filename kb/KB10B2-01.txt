The information in this article applies to:
	Delta Forth .NET 1.0 Beta 2
----

SYMPTOMS:
The IL code generator erroneously builds the ForthStack and ReturnStack objects
as arrays of integer arrays:

	IL_0000: ldc.i4	0x80000
	IL_0005: newarr int32[]		// *
	IL_000a: stsfld	int32[] DeltaForthEngine::ForthStack
	IL_000f: ldc.i4	0x400
	IL_0014: newarr	int32[]		// *
	IL_0019: stsfld	int32[] DeltaForthEngine::ReturnStack

CAUSE:
Human error. :-)

STATUS:
Fixed.
