The information in this article applies to:
	Delta Forth .NET 1.0
----

SYMPTOMS:
Multi-line comments consisting of a single word cause the compiler to behave erratically.

Try this little program:

(Test)
: main
;

The compiler will issue a warning about the missing MAIN method, which is obviously
incorrect.

CAUSE:
The parser enters comment mode and fails to exit at the next ')'

STATUS:
Fixed in version 1.1
