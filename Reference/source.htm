<h1>Source Files Prerequisites</h1>

<hr>

<p>The DELTA Forth system can handle plain ASCII source files. They can be created under
any operating system using appropriate editors. For the MS-DOS platform you can use Edit
or the Norton Editor and for the Windows platform, Notepad is a good choice. Usually, a
DELTA Forth source file has the <strong>.4th</strong> extension, but that may be
different, according to your needs.</p>

<h2><strong>Comments</strong></h2>

<p>In DELTA Forth, just like in any other Forth system, there are ways to introduce
comments in source files. A multiline comment is inserted between parenthesis. A single
line comment is inserted using the back-slash sign.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>( This is a comment</code></p>
  <p><code>spread across</code></p>
  <p><code>multiple lines. )</code></p>
  <p><code>\ This is a one-line comment</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please notice the space after the '(' and '\'.</p>

<h2><strong>Include files</strong></h2>

<p>If, for any reason, you need to include the contents of a file into the currently
compiling file, use the <strong>LOAD</strong> directive (outside words only).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>LOAD 2stack.4th \ Include file for double-wide stack operations</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Words</strong></h2>

<p>A word definition begins with a colon followed by a space and the name of the word, no
longer than 31 characters. The word definition must end with a semicolon, before the end
of the file.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>: HELLO</code></p>
  <p><code>.&quot; Hello world!&quot; CR</code></p>
  <p><code>;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The program begins execution with the word MAIN, which must be defined somewhere in the
source code. Not having a MAIN word defined will issue a compiling error.</p>
