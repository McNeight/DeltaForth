<h1>Constants and Variables</h1>

<hr>

<p><strong>Constants</strong></p>

<p>Constants are used when a value is needed in several places across the source code.
Defining constants results in easier program maintenance and better readability.</p>

<p>DELTA Forth only allows defining constants outside words.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>10 20 VARIABLE VAR20</strong></p>
  <p>This example creates a variable and associates the value 20. The value 10 is lost, as
  it is not associated with anything. When executing VAR20, the corresponding value is
  placed on the stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>

<p>In DELTA Forth, variables are a special kind of constants. They place a value on the
stack as well, but that value represents an address when the programmer can store
something. Each time you define a variable, the allocated address is different. Like the
constants, variables can be defined only outside words.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VARIABLE VAR1</strong></p>
  <p><strong>VARIABLE VAR2</strong></p>
  <p>If executed, the two variables will place different address values on the stack, as
  allocated at compile time. Optionally, if the default allocated space is insufficient (1
  cell), we can use the <strong>ALLOT </strong>word that increases the amount of reserved
  space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VARIABLE MORESPACE 20 ALLOT</strong></p>
  <p>In this example we created variable MORESPACE and reserved 20 additional cells,
  resulting a total of 21 cells.</p>
